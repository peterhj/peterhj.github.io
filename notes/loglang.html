<h2>A logical language for theorem proving and geometry solving</h2>
<br><br>
May 6, 2024
<em>(last updated May 9, 2024)</em>
<br><br>

The following is a brief and high-level summary of a
logical language that is suitable as input to
a theorem prover for geometry solving, e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/peterhj/meringue">Meringue</a>.
<br><br>

<h3>A logical form language</h3>
<br><br>

The input to the theorem prover is a script written in
a <em>logical form language</em>.
By <em>logical form language</em>, we mean something
very much like a <em>logic programming language</em>,
i.e. a language based on Horn clauses with equality and
uninterpreted functions,
except that there is more emphasis on the logical
and less on the extra-logical programming parts,
e.g. cut or non-pure I/O.
<br><br>

For example, the lines:
<br><br>

<pre>
axm for a, b, c the abc {
    triangle(a, b, c) -> abc :- -/collinear(a, b, c)
}
</pre>
<br>

define a logical rule that may be translated into the
following natural language sentence:
&ldquo;Suppose that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are not collinear.
Then, $a$, $b$, and $c$ form a triangle $abc$.&rdquo;
<br><br>

In the line above, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and
<code>c</code> are universally quantified bound variables,
<code>abc</code> is a functionally bound variable,
and <code>triangle</code> and <code>collinear</code> are
free or global variables.
The terms <code>triangle(a, b, c) -> abc</code> and
<code>-/collinear(a, b, c)</code> are logical tuples
representing logical propositions.
Following the Prolog convention, the arrow <code>:-</code>
symbolizes right-to-left inference: given the conditions
on the right-hand-side of the arrow, the conclusion on the
left-hand-side follows.
(Alternatively, the left-to-right arrow <code>-:</code>
would also work analogously.)
The logical negation <code>-/</code> simply follows
the rule of <em>first-degree entailment</em>
[<a href="#AB63" class="cite">AB63</a>],
rather than the <em>stratified negation-as-failure</em>
usually seen in logic programming.
The keyword <code>axm</code>, which begins the definition
of the rule, is rather arbitrary;
other possible keywords include <code>thm</code>,
<code>lem</code>, <code>rule</code>, etc.
<br><br>

The free variables <code>triangle</code> and
<code>collinear</code> above refer to logical relations,
which must be defined prior to their use in a logical rule.
Sensible definitions would be the two lines:
<br><br>

<pre>
symm fun triangle/3+1
symm rel collinear/3
</pre>
<br>

The <code>triangle</code> functional relation has a
functional arity of <code>3+1</code>, i.e. it is a function
of a 3-tuple argument returning exactly 1 output.
The <code>collinear</code> relation simply has a 3-tuple
argument.
The keyword <code>symm</code> marks both relations as
symmetric relations, a light syntactic sugar that auto-defines
logical rules to generate all permutations of their 3-tuple
arguments.
<br><br>

Propositional facts may be declared using standard keywords,
e.g. <code>let ABC <- triangle(A, B, C)</code> or
<code>where -/collinear(A, B, C)</code>.
Proof goals may be specified with a special keyword,
e.g. <code>propose</code>.
<br><br>

<h3>Language extensions</h3>
<br><br>

The logical form language we described above is sufficient
for encoding most olympiad-style geometry problems,
which correspond to fixed-point saturation of
<em>pure</em> (side-effect-free) logical rules,
interpreted with <em>choice</em> of <em>functional</em>
applications.
<br><br>

For more general domains, it makes sense to carve out
alternatives along each of the pure/functional-choice axes
of our logic.
<br><br>

Whereas pure logical rules are sufficient for geometry,
<em>non-pure</em> (or side-effect-ful) logical rules may
be necessary for describing general domains.
Just as a pure logical rule is defined with the help of
the <code>:-</code> or <code>-:</code> arrows,
a non-pure logical rule may be defined by the arrows
<code>:~</code> (right-to-left non-pure rule) or
<code>~:</code> (left-to-right non-pure rule).
<br><br>

Non-pure logical rules additionally may also introduce
non-pure <em>logical destruction</em> <code>~/</code>
on the conclusion side of the rule,
which removes a logical tuple argument.
<br><br>

Even more generally, a non-pure <em>imperative</em>
effect may be introduced with the <code>!</code>
(read: &ldquo;bang&rdquo;) operator.
(In Prolog, the bang operator is typically used for
<em>cut</em>, but we are not here to reproduce Prolog.)
Imperative effects are, most generally, opaque and
sequential (i.e. non-monotonic).
<br><br>

A functional choice as used for geometric constructions
may be generalized to a <em>top-level choice</em>.
Any top-level (pure or non-pure) logical rule may be
marked <code>choose</code> to exempt it from fixed-point
saturation and to instead interpret it during the
evaluation-of-choices phase.
